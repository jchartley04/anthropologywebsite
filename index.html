            `In humans, the foramen magnum is located on the bottom of the skull, closer to the teeth. 
            In contrast, apes have a foramen magnum towards the back of their skull. 
            The human head sits directly on top of the body trunk, while an ape’s head is positioned forward. 

            Another difference is in teeth. Apes have large canines, creating a diastema (gap) between incisors and canines, 
            whereas humans have smaller canines and no diastema. Apes also tend to have a U-Shaped dental arcade which helps with chewing and grinding tougher foods.
            A human dental arcade is much more parabolic suggesting that the human diet has become less tough. 

            Additionally, humans tend to have larger brains, leading to a more rounded skull shape. 
            Apes, on the other hand, have more developed temporal muscles for strong biting.

            In contrast, an ape’s spine is C-shaped, which supports quadrupedalism. 
            Humans also have a barrel-shaped ribcage, while apes have a broader, funnel-shaped ribcage.

            providing an advantage for climbing and swinging. 

            In humans, the shoulder joint points the arms downward, better suited for manipulation and throwing.
